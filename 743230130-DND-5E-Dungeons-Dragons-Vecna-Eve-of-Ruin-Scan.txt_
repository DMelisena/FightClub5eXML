                 emergency involving the missing nobles is the character's most recent assignment.
        2        After a long struggle, the character defeated a powerful sorcerer. ln the throes ofdeath, the sorcerer's magic backfired,
                 opening a portal and shunting the character to Neverwinter. The character has been working for Lord Neverember as a

claims. Indrina assumes Lord Neverember wants to
silence her for what she's discovered.
   If the characters admit to working for Lord Nev-
erember, Indrina doesn't reveal what she knows.
A character who asks why Indrina is here without
revealing who hired the characters can make a DC
18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage
if Indrina is given perfume or otherwise removed
from the cell's offensive smell. On a success, Indrina
reveals her secret knowledge.
  Learning Indrina's discovery counts as a secret
for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in
this book's introduction. Lord Neverember casually
dismisses Indrina's accusation if it's later brought
to his attention, insisting that the woman can't
prove anything.

The cultists disturbed two wraiths bound to the
urns while ransacking the room. The cultists
quickly retreated and haven't been back. The
wraiths emerge from the dust and ash when anyone
opens the door, shrieking, "Vecnans, die!" Theyvent
their rage on nearby creatures, preferring to attack
cultists. The wraiths fight until destroyed.

     Renowned for his bravery but not his judgment,
     Mordenkainen is a powerful spellcaster from Oerth.
     The chaotic neutral, human wizard led a council of
     famous archmages known as the Circle of Eight. He
     later became trapped in the dread realm of Barovia,
     where he lost his spellbook and staff as well as his
     grip on reality and wandered adrift for some time.
     Alustriel trusts Mordenkainen and respects his
     gumption, even though he occasionally embarks
     on tasks that outstrip his capabilities. The real
     Mordenkainen doesn't appear in this adventure,
     though the characters likely believe they're interact-
     ingwith him.

While disguised as Mordenkainen, Kas never lets
his guard down or removes lhe Crown of Lies. Oc-
casionally during this adventure, Mordenkainen is
absent from the sanctum. During these interludes,
the vampire warlord travels to other realms and
eventually deduces where Vecna plans to enact the
multiverse-unraveling ritual. This sets into motion
the betrayal that takes place in chapter 9.

     The characters appear in area 53 of the Sigil sanc-
     tum. The woman leaning toward the characters is
     Alustriel, and the two individuals behind her are
     Tasha and Mordenkainen. "You can't be the answer
     to our Wish," Tasha sneers, while Alustriel shushes
     her and ushers the characters toward the sanctum's
     comfortable lounge furniture.

     At this point, Alustriel explains where the charac-
     ters are and how they arrived, though she doesn't
     understand why they teleported to the sanctum as a
     result of the tr4llsrl spell. She then introduces herself
     and her wizardly companions.
        As the characters try to figure out what's going on,
     Alustriel asks whether they have any ties to Vecna.
     If the characters mention Vecna's Link, Alustriel
     reasons that the characters' fate must somehow be
     interwoven with Vecna's. She surmises that since
     the Wish was unable to fulfill its parameters, it in-
     stead found beings tied to Vecna and brought them
     to Sigil. She then explains everything she knows

\o matter why they're in Web's Edge, all Lolth wor-
shipers here are fanatics devoted to the demon-god.
In a battle against the characters, these fanatics
always fight to the death.

CErrrNcs
The ceilings in most areas of Web's Edge are 20
feet high, with stalactites occasionally jutting down
a few feet. The ceilings in the fodder chamber (area
W9) and Sacred Web Hall (area W12) are 50 feet
ta11 and relatively smooth.

Doons
The doors in Web's Edge are made of iron. The
doors to areas W3, W4, and W5 are sealed with
Arcane lock spells, requiring a successful DC 20
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves'
tools to unlock. Additionally, areas W6a W6d are
iocked and each require a successful DC 15 Dexter-
ity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools to un-
iock. The nalfeshnee in area W5 carries keys to all
the cel1s in area W6. All other doors in Web's Edge
are unlocked.

LrcHrrNc
There are no natural or magical light sources in the
complex. Area descriptions assume the characters
have a light source or some other means of seeing
in the dark. Light sources bring the attention of the
complex's denizens, although the characters might

bear in this cell, Rothgral, is dead. She deserted a
band of mercenaries based near Mithral Hali after

By the time the characters reach Ialos, they should
have met the pilgrims and the Cyran veterans. Both
sides might ask the characters to intervene and
resolve their dispute. Here is a breakdown of the
situation:
What Kalyth Wants. The Cyran veterans want
 to sel1 treasures from their ruined homeland in
 markets outside the Mournland. With the money,
 Kalyth says, she and her comrades can fund new,
    better lives for themselves.
What Mercy Wants. Mercy regards Docenfs (and
    any other items intended for warforged use) as
    sacred. The pilgrims believe that such objects
    belong in the hands of warforged who fought in
    the Last War.
What They'll Settle For. Ultimately, Kalyth's group
    wants money, and Mercy's group wants respect. If
    both parties get what they want, the dispute ends.

ENrnnrNG LANDRo
The invisible barrier described in the "Landro
Features" section below makes it impossible to
enter the colossus via typical means. The barrier is
damaged in three places, ailowing ingress via paths
aiong Mount Ironrot into areas L5, L11, and L16 of
the colossus. Map 4.3 includes a side view of Landro
and the paths that lead into the colossus's interior.
   The easiest way to enter the colossus is through
the mountain caves that lead to area L5. The char-
acters can also search higher up the mountain along
outdoor paths for the entrances to caverns that lead
to areas L11 and L16. Searching for area L11 takes
2d4 hours, and during the characters' search, a
hungry roc ambushes them. Searching for area L16
takes 3d4 hours, and during the characters' search,
they stumble on a nest with two rocs and one roc
egg the height of a human. The angry roc parents
attack the characters, though the rocs don't pursue
ifthe characters flee.

villagers immediately disperse if the characters at-

Trrn Urursr IN UISITION
After the characters are free of the mob, a cloaked
adventurer named Sarusanda Allester approaches
them. Sarusanda is a lawful neutral, human inquis-
itor of the tome (see appendix A) who speaks Ce-
lestial, Common, Draconic, and Elvish, and can cast
Speak with Dead at wi11. She introduces herself and
asks to speak with the characters in private. The
characters can slip into an alley for this discussion,
or they can duck into the Blood of the Vine, the vi1-
lage tavern, for a quiet conversation.

SanuseNnes MrssroN
Sarusanda's initial impression of the characters
depends on how the characters handled the angry
mob. If the party dispersed the mob without harm-
ing any villagers, Sarusanda is friendly toward
the characters. Otherwise, Sarusanda is indiffer-
ent but wary.
  Sarusanda explains that she is a member of the
Uimist Inquisition, an organizalion dedicated to
rooting out evil throughout the multiverse. She asks
the characters what business they have at the house
on the far side of the village.                                                        §,*;lusnruna            Arrr*;rr

iron door. As an action, a character can use thieves'
tools to try to unlock a door, doing so with a suc-

        The characters can learn two secrets in this chapter
        that are applicable to the rules in "The Power of Se-
        crets" section in this book's introduction:
        Marian's Secret. Marian Xavere, one of the archae-
         ologists, holds a lifelong fascination with Acererak
            and the archlich's evil magic, and she was previ-
            ously tempted to study necromancy. See the 'Ar-

    are within a few inches of each other.
       The rod becomes complete, but no character is
    likely yet attuned to it, and the Wizards Three in
    Sigil asked the characters to return to the sanctum
    once all the rod pieces were found. If the characters

    triggers the next part of the story.
       This chapter's early scenes include the chaos
    caused when Kas steals the Rod of Seven Pafts and
    gravely wounds Alustriel and Tasha. The chapter
    progresses to Pandesmos, where the characters find
    a war erupting between Kas's and Vecna's demonic
    forces. The characters must stay on Kas's trail if
    they hope to find Vecna, potentially neutralize Kas,
    and end the threat to the multiverse.

Descriptions for the Ruinous Sea, Hurricane Tower,

not need them. High-level characters have options
for travel to Kas's redoubt without wading through
an active batt1efie1d. However, no options are free
of danger.

The characters can teleport directly to the redoubt's
upper or lower entrances. The characters can't tele-

a Forbiddance spell.

                         cliff. Thick spider webs woven throughout the base

                         within miles of the characters' initial position in
                         Pandesmos.
                           Hurricane Tower is the strategic heart of Lolth's
                         forces. The balor general Camlash uses the tower to
                         organize troops and direct their efforts in the war,
                         so she ordered her spiders to reinforce the struc-
                         ture with webbing. The tower remains standing
                         unless the characters sabotage the six web anchors
                         within it.

                         Lolth isn't present in Pandesmos; she has given
                         command of her legions to Camlash. The balor gen-
                         eral specializes in leading campaigns with troops of
                         loyal driders and mutated arachnids. For this battle,
                         adherents of Lolth have joined Camlash's forces,
                         despite the usual animosity between driders and
                         people. All flght together in Lolth's name.
                           Camlash doesn't enjoy fighting in Pandesmos.

opening. However, the opening isn't wide enough
for Miska to exit, so Miska is widening it. If he can
break free, he canjoin the battle his forces are en-
gaged in and revel in chaos once again. If the rod is
removed or knocked aside, the seal snaps shut and
binds Miska once more.
  Miska isn't idle while trying to free himself. He
commands the armies of spyder-fiends and other
demons through his spyder-fiend battle leaders, the
raklupises. Miska's other spyder-fiends (see appen-
dix A) defend him and implement the demon lord's
complex strategies.
  Yet Miska's position is precarious. While he's a
cunning general, he's unable to command his forces
in person, and enforcing discipline is challenging;
spyder-fiends, like many demons, find order and
organization diffrcult to tolerate. Additionally, Kas
is becoming increasingly frustrated with Miska's      a                a

characters must reduce Kas to 50 hit points or

             On the world of Eberron, many strange,
             magic-warped monsters have emerged from the
             depths of the war-wracked Mournland. The blaze-
             bear is one such monster, so named for its hulking,
             ursine figure and the glow of its eyes. This glow is
             magical energy that saturates the blazebear's en-
             tire body. Swipes from a blazebear's claws dole out
             painful wounds and can end spells, and its gaze can
             stun prey.

2I2   APPENIItX       .4.   I BESTiAITY
Capaven CoLLECToR
Ancient war machines known as cadaver collec-
tors lumber aimlessly across the blasted plains of
Acheron until they are called on by a necromancer
to bolster the ranks of a conquering army on the Ma-
terial Plane. These fearsome Constructs obey their
summoners until they are dismissed to Acheron,
but if a summoner comes to a bad end, a cadaver
collector might wander the Material Plane for centu-
ries, collecting corpses while searching for a way to
return home.
  A cadaver collector responds to a summons from
a mortal only if it is called to the scene of a great
battle-either where one is in progress, where one is
imminent, or where one once took place. The collec-
tor encases itself in the armor and weapons of fallen
warriors, and it impales the corpses of those war-
riors on the lances and other weapons embedded in
the collector's salvaged armor.
  Corpses that accumulate on a cadaver collector's
shell aren'tjust grisly trophies; a cadaver collector
can summon the spirits of these cadavers to battle
against its enemies. Although these specters are
individually weak, a cadaver collector can call up an
almost endless supply of them, if given enough time.

      When a dryad fails to protect its wilderness home
      from a great evil and is unable to forgive itself, the
      dryad might transform into a wicked Fey monster
      called a deadbark dryad. Such dryads relinquish
      any compassion they once felt for living beings and
      instead harbor hatred for anyone who dares to in-                                                                                      A

         The wilds around a deadbark dryad become ma-
      lignant, souring into a swampy morass of stinging
      nettles and noxious muck. Deadbark dryads are im-
      mune to this toxic bog's deleterious effects.
         A deadbark dryad is typically bound to the spot
      where it failed to protect its charge. When a dryad
      transforms into a deadbark dryad, it becomes
      stronger and more violent, and it typically gains a
      renewed dedication to protecting its now-fetid do-
      main. Most deadbark dryads would rather fight to
      the death than allow any intrusion into their homes.
         Deadbark dryads are most often found on Krynn,
      but occasionally they are found on other worlds
      where magic and trees are plentiful.

A deathwolf combines the might of a werewolf, the
unholy powers of undeath, and the magic of the fu1l
moon. Deathwolves are most common on Krynn
but occasionally are found in other locations where
lycanthropy and necromancy are prevalent.
  To create a deathwolf, a necromancer reanimates
the body of a powerful werewolf by conducting a
profane ritual fueled by lunar magic. The result is
an Undead abomination that resembles a skeletal,
shadowy werewolf in hybrid form. Deathwolves
can't shapeshift, but they can create dangerous il-
lusions. A deathwolf's bite makes its victims more
susceptible to the mind-bending phantoms the
deathwolf can conjure.

      Occasionally, liches create nefarious magical copies
      of themselves to fool enemies, to guard treasure, or
      for other inscrutable reasons.
         To create a false lich, a lich binds a shred of its
      life force to a corpse in a profane ritual. This trans-
      forms the corpse into a near-identical copy of the
      lich with immense necrotic power and some of its
      creator's arcane prowess. The creator then embeds
      enchanted gemstofles into the corpse's eye sockets;
      the gems allow the false lich to trap creatures' souls
      and transfer the souls to its creator.
         A false lich often gradually gains a sense of
      self-identity. While many false liches remain stead-
      fastly loyal to their creators, others resent their cre-
      ators for                and abandoning them.

    A granite juggernaut is a lumbering Construct that
    can be found trundling across battlefields and down
    dungeon corridors. Granite juggernauts have dense,
    boxy bodies atop massive rollers they use for loco-
    motion. Their fronts and rollers are often adorned
    with fearsome heads, such as those of enraged
    rhinos. Granite juggernauts are found on many
    worlds and typically are used to protect high-value
    locations.

When a dead god is left adrift in the Astral Sea,
its corpse sometimes spawfls a parasitic monster
known as a hertilod. Voracious and terrifying, a her-
tilod resembles a skinless, serpentine lizard, with
sharp claws and a gaping maw that drips venom.
A hertilod's gruesomely exposed muscle renders it
susceptible to lightning.

       When the spirit of a malevolent trickster or cal-
       lous rogue refuses to enter the afterlife, the spirit
       sometimes becomes a mirror shade instead. Mirror
       shades are incorporeal Undead that, in their true
       forms, look like person-shaped blobs of shining
       light. More often, though, mirror shades are en-
       countered on reflective surfaces such as mirrors or
       panes of glass. There, they blend in seamlessly with
       their reflected surroundings and wait until the mo-
       ment is right to strike. Mirror shades can be found
       throughout the multiverse but are particularly com-
       mon in the Outer Planes.

Pnrnsr oF OsYBUS
The priests of Osybus are necromancers in the
Domain of Dread known as Barovia who once
venerated-and then were betrayed by-a lich of
unfathomable ambition and power. The priests steal
the souls of others to fuel their wicked magic. A
priest of Osybus contains this soul power in shad-
owy tattoos, which the priest can draw on to defy
death and become an lJndead monster.
  Though formidable, the priests of Osybus aren't
truly immortal, a fact that chafes them greatly. They
have forged a pact with the Dark Powers that will
grant them immortality if they free Count Strahd
vonZarovich from the Mists that imprison him. To
achieve this goal, they orchestrate far-reaching and
complex machinations that are virtually inscrutable
to all but their archenemies, the Ulmist inquisitors.

Booxs oF UNDEATH
When a priest of Osybus drops to 0 hit points, the
priest might revive with a benefit from the Boons
of Undeath table below. Before adventurers face a
priest of Osybus, you can decide that the priest has
revived with one or more of these boons of your
choice. Ifyou do so, the priest is Undead rather
than Humanoid. A priest can receive each boon
only once.

The terrors known as spiderdragons were first
found in the deepest corners of the Underdark and
trace their origins to black dragon wyrmlings who
ate a steady diet of spiders. Though spiderdragons
were not created in the Abyss or by Lolth's faithful,
worshipers of the Spider Queen claim that spider-
dragons are a gift from their deity, as spiderdragons
are most numerous in l]nderdark areas that Lolth's
faithful claim as their own. Lolth worshipers might
employ spiderdragons as guards or treat them as
venerated guests. The creatures aren't as powerful
as their black dragon progenitors, though, and they
often drain the enclaves' resources with their self-
ish demands.
   Uninterested in building 1airs, spiderdragons
weave powerful webs and eat an abundance of prey
before losing interest in an area and moving on,
even when they're treated like beloved guests. IJn-
like their black dragon progenitors, spiderdragons
aren't particularly clever, though some of them un-
derstand their significance to Lolth worshipers and
exploit their positions for as long as possible.

    Compared to other animated objects, whirling
    chandeliers seem to have capricious personalities.
    Victims typically perceive a whiding chandelier's

    its master's orders to the best of its ability.

       Also known as the Devourer, Acererak is a power-
       ful archlich feared across many worlds. He takes
       sadistic pleasure in killing adventurers by luring
       them into his trap-riddled tombs with the promise
       of powerful artifacts. Then he feeds on their souls to
       sustain his escapades across the multiverse.

       Hrsrony                                                                                                                 I
       Hundreds of years ago, Acererak was a mortal mage
                                                                                                                         *&t
       from Oerth devoted to the pursuit of power and
       immortality. Some say that Acererak was a pupil of
       Vecna, from whom he learned undeath's secrets.
         Acererak travels the planes in search of powerful
       artifacts. When the archlich finds a particularly
       intriguing one, he seals it in one of his infamous
       tombs to tempt treasure hunters into the dungeon's
       depths. Acererak has filled these tombs with deadly
      traps, fearsome monsters, and twiste d puzzles
      meant to torment and eventually slay would-be
      thieves, whose souls he then consumes.
         The most famous of Acererak's tombs is the Tomb
      of Horrors, which has claimed many adventurers
      throughout its history. Another infamous tomb is the
      Tomb of the Nine Gods, in which Acererak sealed
      nine false gods he had slain there. He has additional
      tombs on Oerth, in Faerün, and beyond.
         Unlike many archliches, Acererak doesn't de-
      sire godhood. Nevertheless, his nefarious deeds
      have garnered him a substantial following. One
      such group of these followers founded the Bleak
      Academy, an institution of arcane and religious
                                                                                                                    ;t
      learning that extols Acererak's power.

      PnnsoNeLrrY
      Acererak delights in watching others perish. He
      regards himself as superior in all aspects, treating
      others as one would annoying insects. He views
      even the creatures he creates as mere tools to serve
      his whims. This hubris has often led him to disaster,
      but as a lich, Acererak continually returns to unlife.

    ArusrRIEL StrvnnHAND
    Lady Alustriel Silverhand, called the Shining Lady,
    has been an influential wizard and proponent of
    good across Toril for centuries. Alustriel is one of
    the Seven Sisters-immortal daughters of Mystra,
    a god of magic. The divine energy Mystra passed
    to Alustriel grants Alustriel incredible power over
    arcane magic.
      Alustriel's youthful appearance as a human
    woman with silver hair gives no hint of her super-
    naturally extended life span. She typically wears
    long robes and wields a unicorn-headed staff, her
    Statr of Silverymoon.

    Hrsronv
    Like other Chosen of Mystra, Alustriel is concerned
    with preserving the Weave, the primary incarnation
    of magic that permeates Toril. She believes that
    the Weave favors those who act with mercy and
    compassion, seeks to deliver lives of security for all,
    and bolsters people's efforts when they seek to right

      Nowhere are Alustriel and her deeds better
f   known than in the Silver Marches and its capital,
      Silverymoon. Alustriel ruled Silverymoon for centu-
      ries, once disguised as a wizard named Elud Dualen
      and then later in her true form. She helped create
      Silverymoon's famous Moonbridge and cofounded
      the Lady's College, the first school in Faerün for
      mages as students rather than as apprentices
      in service.
        Alustriel stepped down as Silverymoon's                            PBnsoNeLrrY

        Miska the Wolf-Spider is a legendary demon lord
        and master of battlefield strategy. He has the lower
        body of a massive armored spider, four arms, and
        two enormous wolf heads that drip poison. Yet Mis-
        ka's greatest strength is his cunning mind.

        Hrsronv
        Ages ago, Miska 1ed the hordes of Chaos against the
        forces of Law at the behest of his patron, the enig-
        matic Queen of Chaos. It seemed Miska's domina-
        tion couldn't be stopped.
           In desperation, Miska's opponents crafted an
        artifact to bind him in an extraplanar prison. This
        rod broke apart after sealing him in Pandemonium,
        scattering across the planes and becoming known
        as the Rod of Seyen Parfs. The rod is the key to re-
        leasing Miska from his long imprisonment.

    Mordenkainen is a human wizard from Oerth
    whose wanderlust and hunger for new magic take
    him across the multiverse. Mordenkainen is calcu-
    iating and mysterious, but he isn't cruel.
       Mordenkainen has been involved in several
    friendly rivalries, including with Tasha, another
    powerful spellcaster from Oerth. Many significant
    figures across the multiverse are aware of Morden-
    kainen, but few truly know him-something the
    vampire Kas exploits to impersonate Mordenkainen.
    Throughout the adventure, Kas is masquerading as
    Mordenkainen. The mage is unaware of the vampire
    warlord's actions.

    Hrsrony
     Mordenkainen has told conflicting tales about his
     origins, but most scholars believe he accumulated
     impressive magical power at a young age. Known
     for his ingenuity, the wizard is responsible for
    writing several planar tomes and creating many
     spells that bear his name, including Mo rdenkain-
     en's Faithful Hound and Mordenkainen's Masnifi-
     cent Mansion.
       As his fame on Oerth grew, Mordenkainen be-
    came the leader of a powerful group of spellcasters
    called the Circle of Eight. The group included sev-
    eral wizards who similarly pioneered new spells,
    including Tbnser and Bigby. Eventually, the circle
    disbanded after it stopped an uprising organized by
    Vecna. That development fueled Mordenkainen's
    lifelong hatred of the lich.
       Mordenkainen travels the multiverse while follow-
    ing his academic whims. Thewizard owns a home
    called the Tower of Urm, which pops into existence
    in Avernus when Mordenkainen visits to study how
    the Nine Hells affect various schools of magic.

    PrnsoNeLrrY
    Mordenkainen is stubborn and egotistical to the
    point of driving even his friends to annoyance. He
    has few close relationships, although nearly allwiz-
    ards recognize his accomplishments. He is lonely
    and dreams of building a community of spellcast-
    ers who support each other. lJnfortunately, his ego
    makes that dream all but impossible.

                  the Darklord's knowledge, although Strahd rarely
                  pays attention to what he considers the uninterest-
                  ing dealings of lesser beings. However, once the
                  characters arrive in Barovia, explore a place called
                  Death House, and find a piece of the Rod of Seven
                  Parfs there, Strahd's interest becomes piqued, and
                  he makes an appearance. The characters encounter

                  Strahd made a pact with the Dark Powers to be-

                  until in a jealous rage he murdered his brother, Ser-
                  gei. Sergei's betrothed, Tatyana, leapt from a tower
                  to escape Strahd and vanished into the Mists rising

                  realm, tormenting him with his inability to escape
                  for all eternity. He spends his days amusing himself
                  as best he can, terrorizing Barovia's people and sa-

                  Tasha's path to greatness began when she was ad-
                  opted by the arch-hag Baba Yaga, who named her
                  Natasha. Tasha went on to create various spells,
                  including Tasha's Hideous Lau§hter, and her mag-
                  ic-fueled ambitions brought her into contact with
                  demons and demon lords, which she subjugated and
                  used against her enemies. On the Material Plane,
                  she became known as Iggwilv the Witch Queen
                  and wrote the Demonomicon of l§§wilv, the great-
                  est of all treatises on the Abyss and its demonic
                  inhabitants. In recent years, Tasha has sequestered
                  herself in the Feywild, achieving incredible power
                  and slowly turning into a Fey creature. Tasha has
                  become Zybilna, archfey of the domain of Prismeer.

                  needed in Prismeer. As a compromise, and to honor
